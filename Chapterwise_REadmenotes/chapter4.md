# Chapter4 - Traning Models (Hands-On Machine Learning)

# What This Chapter Is Really About
- this chapter is about deep understanding of various regression model like linear regression, logistic regression 
- we will learn what gradient descent is and how does it tweaks the model parameters

# Linear Regression
- Linear Regression model prediction (vectorized form)
  y= hθ x =θ·x
-  the most common performance measure of a regression model is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
## Normal equation
- it is an equation which gives the value of theta which minimizes the cost function
- θ = (X^T X)^−1 X^T y
